    <h2>Arrays is an ordered collections of values</h2>
    <p>they can contain a mix of different data types like boolean, null, undefined, string, symbols, bigInt and etc.
        .e.g Array means "reeks". Examples below of where arrays are being used
        <ul>
            <li>list of comments on IG post</li>
            <li>Collections of levels in a game</li>
            <li>Songs in a playlist</li>
            <ul>
                <h3>Creating arrays</h3>
                <li>We use square brackets <code>[]</code> to denote a array</li>
                <li>Don't use typeof to check if something is an array because it will say "object"</li>
                <li>You can put anything in an array, numbers, strings and etc all together. You can even put an array
                    within an array</li>
                <li>rhe array object enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name</li>
                <li>In JS arrays are not primitives but objects</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays are indexed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each array has an index, just like that every character in a string is also indexed
            so each element has a corresponding index. starts at 0
        </li>
        <li>Unlike a string you can change a character or/and element in an array by using the index
            <code>let colors = ['rad', 'blue', 'yellow'] <br>
                colors[0] = 'red'
            </code>
            <br> so this means that the rad has changed into 'red' in the array. we can't do something like this with
            just a string value of a variable
        </li>

    </ul>

    We can add and remove from the end of the array or we can add and remove from the beginning.

    <h2>PUSH AND POP - END</h2>
    <p>push - add to end</p>
    <p>pop - remove from end</p>
    <h2>SHIFT AND UNSHIFT - START</h2>
    <p>shift - remove from start</p>
    <p>unshift - add to start</p>

    <h2>MORE METHODS</h2>
    <p>concat() - combining array method is used to merge to or more arrays. it doesn't change the exisiting arrays but
        instead returns a new array</p>
    <code>prototype.concat(value0, value1, value2....)</code>
    <p>includes() - it's a boolean method to see if a element is included in the array of not -- simple yes or no </p>
    <p>indexOf() -- to see if an element is in an array or not and what the index it is. so it's more detailed than
        includeds(). -1 means its not present</p>
    <p>reverse() -- you don't have to put something in the parentheses it just give you a reversed copy. it reverses the
        original array</p>
    <p>slice() -- getting a slice of an array. </p>
    <p>splice() -- this method doesn't give you a copy it will change the original array</p>
    <p>sort() -- it is sorted in place and no copy is created, so the array is altered with the sorted values. by
        default it will be sort in ascending order BUT if there are any undefined valued they will automatically sorted
        to the back of the array. Use the compareFunction to sort them into proper numerical orderl.
        by using only sort() the numbers will be converted into strings and it will therefore only look at the first
        number and put them in ascending order. </p>


    <h2>REFERENCE TYPES AND EQUALITY TYPES</h2>
    <p>In arrays JS is looking if the reference is the same. they do not look at what's inside if that is the same.
        its not the content that is stored like in primitives, it has to do with references, it has to do with arrows
        pointing in the same direction</p>

    <h2>Replace an value in nested array</h2>
    <code>const airplaneSeats = [
        ['Ruth', 'Anthony', 'Stevie'],
        ['Amelia', 'Pedro', 'Maya'],
        ['Xavier', 'Ananya', 'Luis'],
        ['Luke', null, 'Deniz'],
        ['Rin', 'Sakura', 'Francisco']
        ];

        // YOUR CODE GOES BELOW THIS LINE:
        airplaneSeats[3][1] = "Hugo"</code>

    which means that te 3rd index array and the 1st index of 3rd array will be changed into Hugo.


    <h2>OBJECT LITERALS</h2>
    <p>Objects are a collections of properties. They are a key-value pair.
        An object literal is a comma seperated lits of key-value pairs inside of curly braces. These values can be
        properties or functions. property = key + value
        {key:value}
        objects are unlike arrays not ordered!
    </p>
    <h4>How to acces an object literal</h4>
    <p>every key that we make in objects is converted to a string</p>
    if you want to acces an object literal you need to use square brackets and quotation marks
    <code>let person = {<br>
        firstName: "Mick",<br>
        lastName: "Jagger" } <br>

        person["firstName] </code>

    <p>you can also use the DOT syntax. eg person.firstName or person.lastName</p>
    firstname key is actually a string

    <h4>Adding information and or updating information in OBJECTS</h4>
    <p>by using the square brackets or dot syntax you can update the value of the key.</p>
