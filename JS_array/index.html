    <h2>Arrays is an ordered collections of values</h2>
    <p>e.g Array means "reeks". Examples below of where arrays are being used
        <ul>
            <li>list of comments on IG post</li>
            <li>Collections of levels in a game</li>
            <li>Songs in a playlist</li>
            <ul>
                <h3>Creating arrays</h3>
                <li>We use square brackets <code>[]</code> to denote a array</li>
                <li>Don't use typeof to check if something is an array because it will say "object"</li>
                <li>You can put anything in an array, numbers, strings and etc all together. You can even put an array
                    within an array</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays are indexed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each array has an index, just like that every character in a string is also indexed
            so each element has a corresponding index. starts at 0
        </li>
        <li>Unlike a string you can change a character or/and element in an array by using the index
            <code>let colors = ['rad', 'blue', 'yellow'] <br>
                colors[0] = 'red'
            </code>
            <br> so this means that the rad has changed into 'red' in the array. we can't do something like this with
            just a string value of a variable
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
